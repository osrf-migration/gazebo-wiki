A URI is a uniform resource identifier that tells Gazebo, and other tools, where to find a resource.

Gazebo currently uses three different URI formats.

1.  **model://**

    A URI that starts with `model://` identifies a model within a [[model_database |model database]]. 

1.  **file://**

    An path to a file on the local system.

1.  **http://**

    This is used to locate [[model_database|model databases]].
