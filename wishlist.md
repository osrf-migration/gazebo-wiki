This wish list is a set of features we (the Gazebo community) would like to see in Gazebo. 

If you would like to tackle one of these features, please put your name next to the feature and send a message to the [Gazebo mailing list](http://gazebosim.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/gazebo-list) about your work. Keep in mind that you don't have to work in isolation. Ask for help and we will do our best to provide you with guidance.
